# JavaBuzz in JavaScript

A simple coding challenge called FizzBuzz, written in Javascript and tested with Jasmine, using Console to feature test.

The objective of Javabuzz is to create a program with the following specification:

The program can be passed a number.
When passed a number that is a multiple of 3, the program returns the message 'Java'.
When passed a number that is a multiple of 5, the program returns the message 'Buzz'.
When passed a number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the program ignores the previous 2 rules and returns the message 'Javabuzz'.
In all other cases, the program simply returns the given number.
